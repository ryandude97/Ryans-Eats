My name is Ryan Stroemel. Ryan's Eats is a contemporary steakhouse restaurant with a functional menu. The website currently has features to like and dislike menu items, basic javascrit functionality. It has bootstrap items sprinkled throughout including a carousel within the first section. The style.css serves as a basic stylization of the three html pages. The user can contact the restaurant for any future concerns, etc. Three main improvements: I would like to add a reservations page, as this is important for most restaurants' business models. The css could have been more ornate and less succinct. I would like to maybe have a different color schemes and button functionalities, etc. I would like to see two separate like and dislike buttons and to have that data be captured in realtime in a data table like a csv file.
